•	Accurate Demand Prediction:
The project aims to forecast hourly bike demand in urban areas by building a predictive model using Python and Scikit-learn with historical data. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning were performed to improve model accuracy, ensuring the right number of bikes are available at key times and locations.

•	Reducing Wait Times:
Predicting bike demand with advanced machine learning techniques minimizes user wait times by preventing bike shortages. By visualizing data trends and predictions using Matplotlib and Tableau, the model improves user satisfaction and provides quicker access to bikes during peak hours.

•	Enhancing Accessibility and Coverage:
By optimizing bike availability through a robust demand prediction system, the project enhances accessibility across the city. Segmentation using K-Means clustering in Python further refines service coverage, making rental bikes more convenient and readily available to users.

•	Supporting Urban Mobility:
A stable bike supply fosters a more efficient urban transportation network. Insights drawn from customer group analysis using Pandas and Seaborn help in promoting eco-friendly and accessible mobility solutions, ultimately contributing to a sustainable city environment.
